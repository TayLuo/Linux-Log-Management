Create a Virtual Network (VNet) in the same region where you will deploy the VMs. This will ensure that the client VMs can communicate with the log server.

Go to the Azure Portal and select Virtual Networks from the left-hand menu.
Click + Create to create a new virtual network.
Set the name (e.g., log-vnet), region, and other network configurations.
