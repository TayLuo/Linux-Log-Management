Create a VM that will serve as the centralized log server.
  Go to Azure Portal and click Virtual Machines.
    Click + Create and select Virtual Machine.
      Select the resource group (or create a new one), and give the VM a name like log-server.
        Choose Ubuntu 20.04 LTS as the image.
          Choose a size such as Standard B1s for low-cost usage (can scale up if necessary).
            Create a username and SSH public key for authentication.
              Ensure the VM is placed within the virtual network (log-vnet) and subnet (log-subnet) that you created earlier.
                  Open the Required Ports:

Open the Networking section during VM creation.
Ensure that ports 514 (TCP/UDP) are open to allow logging traffic. You can create a new inbound security rule to allow traffic:
Port: 514
Protocol: Both (TCP and UDP)
Source: Any
Alternatively, you can edit the Network Security Group (NSG) later if needed.

Deploy the VM:

Click Review + Create, then Create to deploy the VM.
