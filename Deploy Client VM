Create VMs that will act as clients, sending logs to the centralized log server. You can create multiple clients to simulate real-world scenarios.

Follow the same steps as creating the log server VM but name the clients something like client1, client2, etc.
Place these VMs in the same virtual network (log-vnet) and ensure they can communicate with the log server.
No need to open ports on client VMs for inbound traffic.
Deploy the Client VMs:

Review and deploy each client VM as you did with the log server VM.
